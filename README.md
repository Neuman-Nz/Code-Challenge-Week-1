# Code Challenge Week-1

## Description
The challenge consists of three javascript files and a html file for testing if the codes work. The three JS codes consist of a net salary calculator that prompts the user to input a basic salary, calculates the taxes (NHIF,NSSF, and PAYE). It then outputs the net salary. The second Js file(speedDector), it prompts the user to input a speed in km/h, where if the driver is below a speed limit of 70, it prints out OK. Otherwise, after every 5km/h, it prints out points:1. If the speed is above 130km/h, the license is suspended. The third JS file genersates a students grade depending on the input the user inputs in the prompt, which only allows numeric input ranging from 0 to 100. The grades are graded as follows: A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40. The HTML file consists of what the user will see while filling the prompt.
